# Terry-Traffic-Stops-Analysis
This GitHub repository analyzes traffic stop data from the landmark Terry v. Ohio case. It examines factors influencing arrests, applies machine learning for predictive analysis, and emphasizes fairness in policing. 
# Traffic Stops Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores traffic stop data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights through machine learning. It focuses on preparing the data, training classification models, and interpreting the results to support actionable conclusions.

## Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing, including cleaning, scaling, and encoding.
- Implementation of both nonparametric (Decision Tree) and ensemble (Random Forest) classification models.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results Summary
The Random Forest model achieved the best results, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in the dataset. Key insights were derived from feature importance analyses and model performance metrics.

## Future Work
- Integrate advanced feature engineering techniques to extract hidden patterns.
- Explore other classification algorithms such as XGBoost or SVM.
- Address dataset biases to improve model fairness and reliability.
